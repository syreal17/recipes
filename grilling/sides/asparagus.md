# The Grilled Asparagus that had a Bit for Everyone

- Cover grill basket with tin foil so that asparagus can cook in extra oil
- prepare asparagus in different pan to avoid putting holes in tin foil
   (a new thing to try, haha)
- prepare asparagus with oil, salt and pepper
- hard to grill this too much, cook in high heat over high burner,
   flame ups are probably good! (425-475*F)
- stir a bit. some will be charred to hell, others pleasantly cooked!
- takes about 30 min.
