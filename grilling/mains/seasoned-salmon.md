# The Grilled Atlantic Salmon that went Horribly Right

- Most important: cut salmon filet into 2-4 oz. chunks
- ALDI salmon that is pre-spiced is really good, but best results with adding more vegetable oil
- cook scale side down over heat just shy of highest (15-20 min)
- turn off burner
- drizzle left over oil and spices over salmon
- flip salmon (scale side should be nearly 100% blackened/charred)
- let drip a bit
- turn burner back on to highest (ensure minimal flame ups) (cook ~10 min more)
- non-scale side should also be quite blackened
- tent the meat
