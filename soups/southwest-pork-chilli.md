## 🫘🐖 Slow Cooker Black Bean & Pork Soup (Serves ~8)
### 🍲 Ingredients:
5 cups cooked black beans (Boil/simmer for 1.25 hrs)

~1½ to 2 lbs pork (shoulder, butt, chops, or leftover roast—trimmed & cubed)

1 onion, diced

3–4 garlic cloves, minced

2 carrots, diced

2 celery stalks, diced

1 bay leaf

2 tsp ground cumin

2 tsp smoked paprika

1 tsp oregano

1 tsp black pepper

1 tsp chili flakes (optional, for heat)

2-3 tsp salt, to taste (start light!)

6–8 cups chicken or pork broth (or water with bouillon)

1 Tbsp olive oil or pork fat (optional, for depth)

Juice of 1 lime (added at the end)

### 👨‍🍳 Instructions:
1. (Optional but recommended) Sear Pork:
Heat a pan, add oil, and brown pork pieces on all sides.

Remove and set aside. This adds flavor but isn’t essential.

2. Build the Soup in the Crock Pot:
Add to the slow cooker:

Cooked black beans

Pork (seared or raw)

Onion, garlic, carrots, celery

All spices and bay leaf

Broth (enough to fully submerge everything)

3. Cook Time:
Low for 6–8 hours, or High for 3–4 hours

Check that pork is fork-tender and beans are creamy

4. Final Touches (last 30 minutes):
Add lime juice

Taste and adjust salt and spices

(Optional) Mash a few beans against the side of the pot and stir for thickness

🥄 Serving Ideas:
Top with chopped cilantro, sour cream, or shredded cheese

Serve with cornbread, tortilla chips, or rice
