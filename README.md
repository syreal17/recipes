# recipes

This is a place for recipes, literally, like for cooking food that you eat
after.  Markdown is about all I need for a decent looking recipes, and GH is
available on all my devices.  It feels weird, but I think this is a better
place for my recipes than apps designed for such a thing, or even FOSS note
apps like Joplin...
