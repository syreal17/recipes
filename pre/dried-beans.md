# Using dried beans

## Overnight soak

Follow directions on bag. I think it's 6-8 cups of water for 1 lb of dried
beans. A large mixing bowl works well.

## Cooking

I wanted to pressure cook, but our big pressure cooker leaked water. Boil beans
in a pot. Reduce heat to simmer once it hits boiling. Use 3 cups of water for 1
cup of beans.
