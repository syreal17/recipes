# Grilled Mexican Delight (Chicken and Veggie)

- I grilled chicken breasts and onions on the grill simultaneously
- Chicken was pretty standard
- Onions were in tin foil pouch in grill basket
- Chicken cooked well
- I was surprised that onions were still unbrown by the end of chicken cooking
   time, so I took them out of pouch and just in grill basket
- And then our rice and beans (leftovers) were cool, so I put a tin foil sheet
   down in basket and put onions on bottom, then black beans (mushy) and rice

I was very pleased with the flavor of the rice and beans after cooking at high heat for a short time on the grill!
